# no1-playerped

* Admins can give peds to the player using /setped [playerid] [model] command or if they want to browse through the models before giving ped, they can simply just type the command /setped [playerid] and it'll pop up a menu to select the ped. If you still don't understand it, please watch the video preview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNiQCnrzfy4).

* Players can access their given ped by using the command /pedmenu from which they can set a given ped as default ped and if they want to reset their skin back, they can do it as well.

* Supports both ESX and QBCore framework.

# Installation
